              <a href="https://julutandjur.se">Jul utan djur </a>("Christmas
              without animals") is a website containing a collection of vegan
              recipes of traditional Swedish Christmas dishes. The intention is
              to showcase the numerous vegan Christmas dishes that have been
              created and inspire people to make an ethical and sustainable
              choice. To date, roughly 7,000 users have visisted the website.

            <p>
              Christmas time is wonderful in many aspects, but it is not great
              for animals: 400,000 Swedish pigs are killed every December, just
              to put meat on the table. Swedish Christmas food traditionally
              contains a lot of meat and fish, but nothing says that is the way
              it has to be. There are multitudes of great vegan recipes
              reinventing the Swedish tradition, and more coming every year. Jul
              utan djur was an attempt to gather the best of these recipes in
              the same place, to create a one stop shop for people looking to
              make their traditions more ethical and sustainable.

            <p>
              For this project, I played every role in the product chain:
              client, designer, coder, content creator (or rather, content
              gatherer - more on that later). This allowed me a great degree of
              freedom, but also meant that I had be careful to not go outside my
              scope. Furthermore, I came up with the idea in late October and
              decided that December 1st would be the perfect date to launch a
              project like this, giving me a neat one month timeframe.
            </p>
            <div>
              <h3 class="sectionHeader" id="idea">3.1. Idea & research</h3>
              <p>
                The idea arose spontaneously one day, and the work on it
                consisted mostly of verifying and developing it. To get inspired
                and gather information about existing patterns and conventions I
                explored a number of recipe websites, taking note on how they
                organized information, handled navigation, and so forth.
              </p>

              <h3 class="sectionHeader" id="sketching">3.2. Sketching</h3>
              <p>
                When planning the layout and structure I decided to stick close
                to the identified recipe website format (because consistency is
                good) while still attempting to simplify things wherever I saw
                the possibility. Visually, I wanted to keep things simple and
                minimalistic in order to let the user really focus on the
                content - the recipes.

                Apart from the Start page and the About page, the site consists
                of three different views: a recipe overview page, showing all
                existing recipe categories; a category recipe page, showing
                recipes for a particular category; and the single recipe page,
                showing the recipe itself. On both the overview and the category
                pages there is a search field, allowing users to simply start
                typing in order to filter the displayed recipes.

                3.3 Coding & Content Creation
              </h3>
              <p>
                For implementing the frontend, I wanted to keep things
                lightweight and fell for the<a href="https://getskeleton.com"
                  >Skeleton CSS framework</a
                >, which had every feature I wanted and very little else. For
                easier organization and updateability, the frontend was built
                using React, which was the hippest framework at the time and
                worked very well in this implementation. To serve all this, I
                decided to keep it simple and stick to what I knew, and so went
                with an Express server in a basic configuration.
              </p>
              <p>
                As soon as the structure was in place it was time to start
                filling it with content. This meant gathering recipes! To do
                this, I simply looked online for great recipes, and whenever I
                found a good one, I simply contacted the creator and asked if I
                could use it. Everyone was incredibly nice and most agreed to
                not only let me use the recipes but also their pictures of the
                dishes. For the few recipes where this was not a case, or where
                there were no pictures of the dishes, I simply had to cook up a
                (delicious) batch and take pictures myself.

            <p>
              This was the first real web project I brought from initial idea to
              finished product, and I learned a lot doing it. Particularly
              interesting was taking the holistic point of view and considering
              the whole process rather than focusing on only the UX or the code.
              Looking back, there are certainly changes that could be made (for
              example: why isn't the user shown the recipes immediately? That is
              what they would be looking for), and I may revisit the project in
              the future with a more focused and design centered approaching,
              but all in all I am quite happy with how it turned out.
