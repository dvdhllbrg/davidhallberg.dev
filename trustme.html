              The project resulted in a concept for an autonomous car interface
              utilizing anthroporphism. The final prototype can be seen in the

            <p>
              Trust toward machines is an ever more relevant issue in today's
              society, and the automotive industry is no exception. As
              autonomous cars become more prevalent, making sure passengers
              trust them becomes an ever more relevant topic of inquiry. This
              project intended to define the issues faced by designers of
              autonomous car interfaces as well as propose methods for
              overcoming these issues, where possible. The project was carried
              out in collaboration with Huawei, as part of a course on
              human-centered design at Chalmers University of Technology.

              various aspects of trust, followed by ideation of concepts. Once
              an idea was chosen, an iterative process of prototyping and user
              testing followed. A video of the final concept can be seen above.

                3.1. Literature Study
              </h3>
              <p>
                The project started of with a literature study on the subject of
                trust. The findings indicated three main important
                considerations:
              </p>
              <dl>
                <dt>A) Utilize anthropomorphism</dt>
                <dd>
                  Anthropormorphism is the act of making something nonhuman seem
                  human. Something as simple as giving a car a name, voice, and
                  gender, increases the passengers' trust in it.
                </dd>
                <dt>
                  B) Present information on <em>why </em>rather than
                  <em>how </em>
                </dt>
                <dd>
                  When an autonomous car does something, it is more important
                  that the interface shows why it is doing it rather than what
                  specific action it is taking. Presenting only how information
                  leads to dangerous driving performance from the humans in the
                  car, while presenting both why and how information bothers
                  drivers by creating a greater cognitive load.
                </dd>
                <dt>C) Provide adequate feedback</dt>
                <dd>
                  Two different kinds of feedback should be given: action
                  feedback (immediate feedback indicating whether an action was
                  successful), and learning feedback (more detailed, leading to
                  slower but more persistent learning). Vocal feedback is safer
                  and more understandable than just a display and an acoustic
                  beep.
                </dd>
              </dl>
              <p>
                Finally, two scenarios were identified that were considered to
                require high levels of trust in the autonomous car. Firstly,
                when the car is required to perform sudden evasive maneuvers in
                order to prevent an accident; secondly, when the car is driving
                in tight spaces such as in a middle lane or exiting a parking
                garage.

                3.2. Prototyping & User Testing
              </h3>
              <p>
                The prototyping phase consisted of two design iterations, with
                user testing after the first iteration to evaluate it and
                provide data for the second iteration. Unfortunately, due to
                time constraints the final version was not evaluated.

              </h4>
              <p>
                Armed with knowledge from the literature study, an initial
                concept was developed (shown in figure 1). Three main features
                were implemented to address the aspects mentioned above: an
                abstract representation of the car's artifical intelligence, a
                heads up display (HUD), and a screen located at the center of
                the dashboard.

                    alt="A view from the inside of a car looking out through the windshield, with an indicator marking another car on the road. Additionally, the dashboard contains a screen showing a drawing of a car with a man and a frog icon displayed on top; over the screen sits a circular blue light."

              </figure>
              <p>
                The HUD was intended to display the planned route and indicate
                other cars, but was relatively quickly deemed unfeasible and
                abandoned. The AI is represented by a round blue light which
                blinks in rhythm with the voice when the car is "speaking" and
                slowly pulsates otherwise - intended to evoke anthropomorphism
                by communicating that the car is a living, breathing entity. For
                the center display, the main feature is a number of indicators
                which appear when there are objects nearby, illustrating these
                objects' positions relative to the car. For further
                customization, the passengers can select profile pictures to
                represent individuals in the car and their seating arrangements
                (note the man and frog icons in the image).

              <h4 class="sectionHeader" id="userTesting">
                3.2.2. User Testing
              </h4>
              <p>
                User testing consisted of placing participants in front of a
                display showing the interface over three different driving
                scenarios, created from dash cam footage of a car driving in
                Gothenburg (a frame from the displayed video is shown in figure
                2). The participants were seated in alignment with the driver
                seat to increase immersion and encouraged to think aloud during
                the test.
              </p>
              <p>
                In total, five tests were performed, with participants aged 23
                to 34. Three participants had a driver's license. The tests were
                performed in five stages, alternating calm sections with
                critical scenarios. After each sequence, participants rated on a
                five-point
                <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Likert-Scale"
                  >Likert scale </a
                >how much they felt they could trust the autonomous driver
                (dubbed Lisa), how relaxed they felt, and if they would prefer
                to take over control from the autonomous driver. After
                completing all sections, participants where asked questions
                about their overall feeling of trust in Lisa, how safe they
                felt, whether Lisa knew how to drive and how aware Lisa was to
                potential dangers in traffic.

                The overall results were positive, with participants feeling
                trust and relaxation without wanting to take control. A trend is
                noticeable where participants feel less inclined to take control
                as the test progresses, suggesting an increase in trust over
                time. After all driving scenarios, only one participant did not
                trust Lisa. However, with regards to feeling safe, only two
                agreed while two others disagreed and one was neutral. All
                participants considered Lisa a competent driver aware of
                potential dangers. There was some confusion regarding the blue
                light, with participants being unsure what it was supposed to
                represent. Furthermore, they wanted information on distance to
                other objects, not simply their relative position to the car.
                Some also requested information on the car’s destination and
                planned route.

              <p>
                Responding to data from the user test, a second prototpye was
                designed. The center display was updated to show surrounding
                objects from a top-down view - meaning that speed and distance
                can easily be determined - as well include features similar to a
                GPS navigation device, such as the planned route. The pulse
                frequency of the blue light was adjusted to more closely mimic
                human breathing. The final design can be seen in the figure 3,
                as well as in the concept video above.

              The project was a huge learning experience in many regards.
              Getting immersed in human-centered design and continously applying
              the principles throughout the project really showcased the
              strength of the design philosophy. User testing was immensely fun
              and valuable, and getting to perform the test was a great lesson
              for the future. It was also interesting to work with a real
              corporate stakeholder - based in another country! - and getting
              their perspective and learning about their goals and objectives.
              Finally, it was incredibly interesting to work with the subject of
              trust and how to design for it, something that will likely only
              become more important in the future.
