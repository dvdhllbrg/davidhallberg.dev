        <p>A couple of years ago, I fell in love with UX. Before that I thought I wanted to be a programmer, and I was studying the bachelor’s program in Software Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology to get there. However, as I started working extra as a developer I slowly came to realize that what really got me going was constructing the scaffolding that enabled users to have meaningful and enjoyable experiences.</p>
        <p>This realization led me to the master's program Interaction Design & Technologies at Chalmers, where for two years I studied design methodologies, UI and UX design, user research, and much more. It was, to put it simply, amazing, and my love for UX only kept on growing. I am still in awe of the power UX has to make a real difference - by making people's lives simpler, but also more delightful - and I truly believe that making it easier for humans and computers get along is one of the most important tasks that exists today.</p>
